# UN_4_Staple_Crop_Data

This was a project that looked at UN Crop Data statistics found here: http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx under FAOSTAT and then selection Rice, Potato, Wheat, and Corn (maize). It used k-nearest neighbors to infer the nature of the production of these crops, as well as to detect if there were any major changes during COVID (based on what could be reasonably predicted, vs the actual recorded values).

The project admittedly needed better visualization, but it was a great application of k-nearest neighbors. It involved some data munging before analysis, which is evident in the .rmd file.
